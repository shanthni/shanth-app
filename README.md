## US Federal Court Criminal Data Project

This project processes over 1.2 million rows of federal court data and combines this with GIS and census data to create interactive visualizations of criminal cases in the US. 

### Application
Users can select each state to view information on that state's data. The below example shows results for Massachusetts. By clicking on the counties in the map, users can see a table of all terminated court cases in that county.
